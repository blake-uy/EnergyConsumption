# Energy Consumption Data Visualization

Class project designed to show the different forms of data visualizations through R coding and ggplot2. 

Purpose of the project:

  - develop a critical eye for graphs and tables
  - experience thinking through and creating data to be imported in R for analysis
  - use the ggplot2 package to add layers to a graph
  - practice proper principles for creating graphs and tables in R (as offered by course readings), as preparation for the final project visualizations
  - practice and receive feedback on presentations as preparation for the final consulting project presentations
  - share and hear about different difficulties with data preparation, wrangling, and data visualizationâ€”so that we might learn from each other for future projects

The data proves that the energy consumption between the years 2000 and 2015 may not be as drastically different as previously thought.
